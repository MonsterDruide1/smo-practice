# Practice Mod

This is a mod for Super Mario Odyssey that adds different features that intend to aid in speedrun practice (but can also be used for other reasons)

The mod is compatible with versions 1.0.0 and 1.3.0 of Super Mario Odyssey, note that the 1.0.0 version is more feature-complete than the 1.3.0 version
### Features
- Position saving and restoring
- Moon refreshing
- Toggle Autosaving on/off
- Stage warping
- Info display (player position, velocity, speed, etc.)
- TAS Script Player
- Other small features

## Prerequisites

- [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/) 
- Python 3
- The [Keystone-Engine](https://www.keystone-engine.org/) Python Module

## Building

Before building, fetch all of the headers included externally:
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Build has only been tested on Arch Linux

Just run:
```
DEVKITPRO={path_to_devkitpro} make
```
devkitPro will be installed to `/opt/devkitpro` on most Unix-based systems

By default, the mod is compiled for the SMO `1.0.0` version. 
To compile for the `1.3.0` version, you can run the following command.

```
DEVKITPRO={path_to_devkitpro} make S2VER=130 S2VERSTR=1.3.0
```

## Installing (Atmosphère)

After a successful build, transfer:

For the SMO version `1.0.0`,

- `smo-practice100.nso` to `/atmosphere/contents/0100000000010000/exefs/subsdk1` (note: no extension)
- `starlight_patch_100/3CA12DFAAF9C82DA064D1698DF79CDA1.ips` to `/atmosphere/exefs_patches/starlight_patch_100/3CA12DFAAF9C82DA064D1698DF79CDA1.ips`
- `romfs` to `/atmosphere/contents/0100000000010000/romfs`

For the SMO version `1.3.0`,

- `smo-practice130.nso` to `/atmosphere/contents/0100000000010000/exefs/subsdk1` (note: no extension)
- `starlight_patch_130/B424BE150A8E7D78701CBE7A439D9EBF.ips` to `/atmosphere/exefs_patches/starlight_patch_130/B424BE150A8E7D78701CBE7A439D9EBF.ips`
- `romfs` to `/atmosphere/contents/0100000000010000/romfs`

## Install (Yuzu)

First open the Yuzu `Mod Data Location` for SMO. 
It can be opened by right-clicking on the game in yuzu (alternatively `%YUZU_DIR%/load/0100000000010000`). 
Then make a new folder for the practice mod and transfer the following files into the newly created folder.
- `smo-practice100.nso` to `<new-folder>/exefs/subsdk1` (note: no extension)
- `starlight_patch_100/3CA12DFAAF9C82DA064D1698DF79CDA1.ips` to `<new-folder>/exefs/3CA12DFAAF9C82DA064D1698DF79CDA1.ips`
- `romfs` to `<new-folder>/romfs`

After the file transfer, the new folder should have the following structure,

```
├── <new-folder-name>
│   ├── exefs
│   │   ├── 3CA12DFAAF9C82DA064D1698DF79CDA1.ips
│   │   └── subsdk1  <-- smo-practice100.nso
│   └── romfs
│       ├── DebugData
│       │   └── ...
│       └── LayoutData
│           └── ...
```

For SMO version `1.3.0`, transfer the `smo-practice130.nso` and `starlight_patch_130/B424BE150A8E7D78701CBE7A439D9EBF.ips` instead.
